# FirstProgram
Definitions:
<?php - Opening tag of any code. Meant to indicate that the code should be read from here on
declare - Syntax that executes the code in the parenthesis
strict_types - Ensures that primitive data types remain consistent
use - Similar to import in Java. Can be used to incorporate elements from other classes.
final - Using this keyword would mean the class or method is set in stone and it cannot be extended by another class
class - Collection of methods and varibales that compile to perform a certain operation
extends - Used to create a new class that is based off a parent class
public - Public class members can be accessed everywhere
function - A block of statements that compile to perform a certain task in the program
void - No concrete value is being returned 
$this - Reference to the current object
assertInstanceOf - An assertion that is part of the PHP database. If an instance does not match the expected input, an error is thrown.
expectException - Used primarily for text code. Raises an error if an exception is found
assertEquals - If two variables arent equal to each other, than an error is thrown.
private - Private variables or methods can only be accessed in the class where it has been defined in
string -  variables that contain alphanumeric characters and are created when you declare variable and assign string characters to it
and when you can directly use them with echo statement. 
int -  called by the constructor, and is used to not have to rewrite the constructor itself.
the actual init() function is not used in PHP instead _contruct is used after a class is declared.
return - causes the function to end its execution immediately and pass control back to the line from which it was called. To return 
a reference from a function you can use it where you declare the function and when assigning the returned value to a variable.
self - are used to access properties or methods. It is used inside the class definition.
new - is an object, and you can use the new statement to instantiate a class
throw - a generic exception where you instantiate an exception object—with the first parameter of the Exception constructor being the error message—and then, "throw" it.
sprintf - returns a string produced according to the formatting string. It has two parameters
static - declaring class properties or methods as static makes them accessible without needing an instantiation of the class. 
A property declared as static cannot be accessed with an instantiated class object (though a static method can).
assertClassHasAttribute - If a certain method or variable does not exist in the class, an error will be thrown.
method_exists - Checks if the class method exists in the given object and is called before specified object parameters.
float - a number with a decimal point or a number in exponential form. It may be used anywhere as a variable,
